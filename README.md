# java bootcamp

Simple exercises I have put together, used to introduce new hires to java, specifically java 8.

The **master** branch has all the tests in place but none of the code required to make the tests pass.

The **one-line** branch is a more experimental approach to the exercises where an attempt has been made to solve each problem using a single line of code (ternarys, streams, recursion allowed and encouraged)

The **clean** branch is a more structured approach that focuses on more clean, succinct and efficient solutions.

There are two approaches for running the tests
* import the project into your ide, add the junit library and run the tests as junit tests
* install **ant** and **ivy**, navigate to the scripts folder and run the `ant test` command
